# ðŸ¦‰ CLI-Chat

A minimalist, real-time chat client that lives in your terminal â€” because not everything needs to be a web app.

Built in Python. Runs over WebSockets. Talks like a wise owl.

## ðŸš€ What is This?

CLI-Chat is a lightweight command-line chat app that connects you to a shared chatroom using nothing but your terminal.  
It works on Mac, Linux, and Windows (I even built a `.exe`).

## ðŸ“¦ How to Install

### ðŸ”§ Option 1 â€” Python Way (for devs)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Onaga08/CLI-Chat.git
cd CLI-Chat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python chat.py
````

### ðŸªŸ Option 2 â€” Windows `.exe`  (The Smoothest Way)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Onaga08/CLI-Chat/releases)
2. Download `chat.exe`
3. Double click
4. Enter nickname + token
5. Youâ€™re in ðŸ§™

### ðŸªŸ Option 3 â€” Mac `Homebrew` (The Smoothest Way)

If you're on macOS and you trust the owl, Homebrew has your back.
Just open Terminal and run:

```bash
brew tap Onaga08/chat
brew install chat
```

Then start chatting with:

```bash
chat
```

### Note - Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter your nickname and token â€” every time. Because owls donâ€™t remember. They just watch. ðŸ¦‰
